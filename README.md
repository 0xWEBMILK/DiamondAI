## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the price of diamonds using various features like carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and other characteristics. This project leverages regression techniques to create a predictive model that can estimate the price of a diamond given its features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains the following features:

- **Carat Weight**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: The quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Very Good, Good, Fair).
- **Color**: The color grade of the diamond (e.g., D, E, F, G).
- **Clarity**: The clarity grade of the diamond (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2, SI1).
- **Polish**: The quality of the polish (e.g., Excellent, Very Good, Good).
- **Symmetry**: The quality of the symmetry (e.g., Excellent, Very Good, Good).
- **Report**: The grading report (e.g., GIA, AGSL).
- **Price**: The price of the diamond in USD.

Example of dataset records:
```
1.1, Ideal, H, SI1, VG, EX, GIA, 5169
0.83, Ideal, H, VS1, ID, ID, AGSL, 3470
```

## Model

The model is built using regression techniques. The features are used to train the model to predict the `Price` of the diamond.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xwebmilk/diamondai.git
cd diamondai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

The model has been evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure its accuracy. Example results will be provided in the repository's documentation.
